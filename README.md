## Objective

The **SALT'EAUX** project investigates the impact of increasing soil salinity‚Äîparticularly in coastal vineyards‚Äîon grapevine physiology, root architecture, berry development, and yield. The goal is to identify physiological indicators and management strategies to mitigate salinity-induced stress.

## Context

### üå± Salinity and Grapevine Physiology

- Soil salinization is a growing concern due to rising evaporation and poor drainage.
- Grapevines tolerate moderate salinity (up to ~2 dS/m), but yield and vegetative growth are significantly reduced under higher salt concentrations.
- Two phases of stress were explored:
  - **Osmotic phase** (early reduction in water uptake)
  - **Ionic phase** (long-term sodium accumulation in leaves)

### üìç Experimental Sites

- Analyses were conducted at **Jarras** and **Villeroy** vineyards (southern France).
- Vine plots were categorized as **salt-affected** (PS) or **non-affected** (PNS) based on field symptoms and sodium content in soil and plant tissues.

## Key Insights from the SALT'EAUX Phase 1 Report

- Sodium in canes (winter tissues) proved more reliable than soil sodium to indicate plant-level salt toxicity.
- SPAD and Florapulse provided insight into physiological functioning under salinity.
- Berry volume tracking and ¬∞Brix dynamics helped evaluate yield quality under stress.
- Soil salinity was mapped in 3D using **EM38-MK2 geophysical tools** and advanced statistical modeling (BRT and kriging).

## How to Use

Each script can be run independently depending on the dataset available. You may need:
- R packages: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `lubridate`, `ggpubr`, etc.
- Input data files (e.g., CSVs with plot-level observations)
